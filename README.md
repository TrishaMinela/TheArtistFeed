## The Artist Feed
## Overview
This is a simple website project created as a part of my learning journey in web development. The website aims to serve as a virtual art gallery called "The Artist Feed", where artists can showcase their work, engage with the audience, and potentially sell their artwork.

## Purpose
The primary purpose of this project is to practice and apply various web development skills, including HTML, CSS, and basic JavaScript. By working on this project, I aimed to:

Gain hands-on experience in designing and developing a website from scratch.
Understand the importance of planning and organization in web development projects.
Learn how to structure content effectively and create a visually appealing layout.
Implement responsive design techniques to ensure compatibility across different devices and screen sizes.

## Features
Homepage: Provides an introduction to the website and its purpose. Displays featured artwork.
My Feed: Showcases a collection of artwork titled "Gallivanting", with descriptions provided by the artist.
Your Feed: Presents opportunities for engagement, including information about art exhibitions and school partnerships.

## Learning Outcomes
Through the process of planning and developing this website, I learned several valuable lessons in web development, including:

Planning: Understanding the importance of thorough planning before starting any coding work. This includes defining project goals, outlining site structure, and creating wireframes.
Organization: Learning how to organize project files, assets, and code to maintain a clean and manageable codebase.
Problem-Solving: Developing problem-solving skills by encountering and resolving various technical challenges throughout the project.
Creativity: Exploring creative ways to design and present content to enhance user experience.


##  Future Improvements
While this project serves as a foundational learning experience, there are several areas where it could be improved or expanded in the future, including:

Implementing additional functionality, such as user authentication and artwork upload features.
Enhancing the visual design and user interface to create a more polished and engaging experience.
Optimizing performance and accessibility to ensure the website is fast and usable for all users.
